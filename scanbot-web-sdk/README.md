# Scanbot Web SDK

## JavaScript Document Scanner, Barcode Scanner, and Data Capture SDK for the Web

The Scanbot Web SDK makes it possible to add barcode-, MRZ-, as well as 
[document scanning to your website or to your web application](https://scanbot.io/products/document-scanning/web-document-scanner/).

The Scanbot Web SDK is based on WebAssembly and the HTML Media Capture API and can be used on iOS 14.5+

## Barcode Scanner for the Web
The [Web Barcode Scanner](https://scanbot.io/products/barcode-software/web-barcode-scanner/) allows you to easily 
implement barcode scanning. Determine the barcode type, the data contained in it, and data from a potentially 
binary result (rawBytes).

Access the available cameras on the mobile device, choose the customizable interface, configure the settings for the 
barcodes, and let your users easily scan any barcode in your web application.

Enterprise-grade scanning and parsing of a large number of different barcode symbologies with any smartphone or tablet.
